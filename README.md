# Mewgenics Save Scum Script

A simple script to quickly close and restart Mewgenics from Steam. Useful for resetting runs without triggering the game's anti-save scumming measures.

## What It Does

- Force closes Mewgenics (simulates an unexpected crash)
- Waits 2 seconds for clean shutdown
- Automatically relaunches the game through Steam

## Installation

1. Download both files (or download Release version for them zipped together):
   - `restart_mewgenics.bat`
   - `restart_mewgenics.ps1`

2. Place both files in the same folder (anywhere on your PC - desktop, downloads, etc.)

3. That's it! Keep them together.

## How to Use

Simply double-click `restart_mewgenics.bat` whenever you want to restart Mewgenics.

**Optional:** Create a desktop shortcut to the `.bat` file for even quicker access.

## Requirements

- Windows 11 (should work on Windows 10 too)
- Mewgenics installed via Steam (default C: drive location)
- Steam must be running
